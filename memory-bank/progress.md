## Known Issues

### Technical Issues

1. **Performance**
   - Large Blockly workspaces can experience rendering lag on lower-end devices
   - WebSocket reconnection can be unreliable in certain network conditions
   - Database queries may slow down with large datasets

2. **Compatibility**
   - Some Blockly features have inconsistent behavior across browsers
   - Mobile experience needs further optimization for smaller screens
   - Touch interactions with Blockly can be imprecise

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Docker image size is larger than desired
   - Development environment setup has several manual steps
   - CI pipeline occasionally fails with timeout issues

### User Experience Issues

1. **Usability**
   - Onboarding process needs refinement for new users
   - Error messages could be more helpful and actionable
   - Some UI elements lack sufficient contrast for accessibility

2. **Content**
   - Limited number of pre-built tutorials available
   - Documentation for content creators is incomplete
   - Localization is incomplete for some languages

3. **Integration**
   - Limited export options for created content
   - No direct integration with popular LMS platforms
   - API documentation needs improvement

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architectural Changes

1. **State Management**
   - **Initial Approach**: Context API with useReducer
   - **Current Approach**: Jotai for atomic state management
   - **Rationale**: Better performance and simpler API for complex state requirements

2. **API Design**
   - **Initial Approach**: REST API with Express
   - **Current Approach**: Hono framework with OpenAPI integration
   - **Rationale**: Improved performance, better TypeScript integration, and automatic documentation

3. **Database**
   - **Initial Approach**: MongoDB
   - **Current Approach**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
   - **Rationale**: Better type safety, relational data modeling, and transaction support

### Feature Prioritization

1. **Visual Programming**
   - **Initial Focus**: Basic Blockly integration
   - **Current Focus**: Custom blocks, performance optimization, and user experience
   - **Future Direction**: Advanced block libraries and extensibility

2. **User Management**

3. **Content Creation**
   - **Initial Focus**: Predefined tutorials
   - **Current Focus**: Basic tutorial creation tools
   - **Future Direction**: Comprehensive content management system with templates

### Technical Debt Management

1. **Code Organization**
   - **Initial State**: Monolithic components with mixed concerns
   - **Current State**: Improved separation but still some large components
   - **Target State**: Fully modular architecture with clear boundaries

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - **Initial State**: Minimal manual testing
   - **Current State**: Basic unit tests and some E2E tests
   - **Target State**: Comprehensive test coverage with automated CI/CD integration

3. **Documentation**
   - **Initial State**: Minimal inline comments
   - **Current State**: Improved comments and basic documentation
   - **Target State**: Comprehensive documentation for developers and users
