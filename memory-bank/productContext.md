# Product Context: TutoriaLLM

## Why This Project Exists

TutoriaLLM addresses several critical challenges in K-12 programming education:

1. **Accessibility Gap**: Traditional programming education often requires text-based coding, which can be intimidating and inaccessible for younger students or beginners. TutoriaLLM bridges this gap by providing a visual programming interface using Blockly.

2. **Educational Resource Limitations**: Many schools lack specialized programming teachers or structured curriculum materials. TutoriaLLM enables educators without extensive programming backgrounds to create and deliver high-quality programming education.

3. **Engagement Challenges**: Maintaining student engagement in programming education can be difficult. TutoriaLLM creates an interactive, dialogue-based learning experience that provides immediate feedback and guidance.

4. **Customization Needs**: Educational needs vary across different contexts, age groups, and curricula. TutoriaLLM offers a flexible platform that can be customized to meet diverse educational requirements.

5. **Self-Hosting Requirements**: Educational institutions often need control over their educational technology infrastructure for privacy, security, and customization reasons. TutoriaLLM provides a self-hosted solution that gives institutions this control.
