With this platform, you can easily create programming tutorials and provide them to learners. Both the tutorial creators and users can enjoy a better learning experience through this app.

### For Learners

Users who access the tutorials can learn the basics of programming through interactive sessions with the LLM (AI) via an intuitive interface. All that's required is a web browser, and since sessions are managed server-side, you can resume from any device.

Additionally, programs created in tutorials are executed server-side and can integrate with other applications. Currently, integration with Minecraft is supported, allowing you to run your programs.
