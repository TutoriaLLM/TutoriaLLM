TutoriaLLM is a self-hosted programming learning platform using LLM, available on the web. This platform is designed for those who create educational content and those who learn from it.

  TutoriaLLM is software for creating tutorial-providing websites on servers and
  is not the name of a standalone application. Anyone can host an application

With this platform, you can easily create programming tutorials and provide them to learners. Both the tutorial creators and users can enjoy a better learning experience through this app.

### For Learners

Users who access the tutorials can learn the basics of programming through interactive sessions with the LLM (AI) via an intuitive interface. All that's required is a web browser, and since sessions are managed server-side, you can resume from any device.

Additionally, programs created in tutorials are executed server-side and can integrate with other applications. Currently, integration with Minecraft is supported, allowing you to run your programs.
