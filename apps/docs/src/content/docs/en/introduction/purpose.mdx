## Introduction

Hello. I am [So Tokumaru](https://tokumaru.work), the developer of TutoriaLLM. I became interested in creating digital works when I started playing Minecraft in elementary school.
Utilizing that knowledge, I have been teaching programming to children since I was in high school.

## Background

My own experiences played a significant role in the background of developing this app.

### Experience as a Learner

First, my experience as a learner.
I became interested in programming through games like Minecraft when I was in elementary school, but there were not many opportunities to learn programming at that time.
Even though I was interested, it was just a "this looks fun!" level of interest, so I didn't try to learn on my own.
I eventually realized the fun of programming when I was in high school, but if there had been people around me who could teach programming, I might have realized its fun much earlier.
I always thought it would be great if there were an environment where I could easily get in touch with programming much earlier.
Using online materials might solve these issues to some extent, but it often ends up being one-way communication.

### Experience as a Teacher

Then, after becoming a high school student and taking on the role of teaching programming, I also felt various problems from the perspective of a teacher.
There are not enough people to teach programming, and even now, when programming education is becoming more popular, I think the demand is not being met.
I also felt it was a problem that there are children who do not have the opportunity to get in touch with programming due to language or economic circumstances.

## What to Offer to Society

Noticing the increasing performance of AI and the active exploration of its use in the field of education, I decided to develop an app related to programming education, utilizing my experiences as both a learner and a teacher.
Initially, I started developing it to solve the "annoying" things I felt when I was teaching as a teacher, but gradually I aimed to create an app that could provide more people with the opportunity to learn programming by leveraging my experiences.
I thought that others might have had similar experiences, and my goal is to make the app available to such people as well.
I plan to develop this software as open-source and provide it to educational institutions and companies as a foundation, so that more people can have the opportunity to learn programming.
