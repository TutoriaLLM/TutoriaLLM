## TutoriaLLM Repository Structure

```md
![Repository Structure](../../media/images/stacks.png)

TutoriaLLM consists of two main systems: the frontend and the backend. The frontend is built with React, Vite, and Tanstack Router, while the backend is built with Hono and Node.js. It uses PostgreSQL as the database. Additionally, there is an extension system that provides functionality for integrating with external applications like Minecraft.
```

### Frontend

```md
The frontend is built with React, Vite, and Tanstack Router. You can use any editor to edit the code and run the app in a local environment using Node.js.
```

### Backend

```md
The backend is built with Hono and Node.js, requiring PostgreSQL as the database. It works alongside the frontend to manage the application's data. The backend is provided as a Docker image, which can be deployed on a server using tools like Docker Compose for database connectivity.  
This page explains how to run the application in a local environment for development purposes.
```

## Cloning the Repository

```md
Clone the GitHub repository to start development. You can use your preferred editor to edit the code and run the application locally using Node.js.
```

```md

```

## Setting Environment Variables

```md
Below is an example of the required environment variables. Set these in `/apps/frontend/.env` and `/apps/backend/.env`.
```

### `/apps/frontend/.env`

```env
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### `/apps/backend/.env`

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxxxxx"
OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT="https://your-openai-api-endpoint"

CORS_ORIGIN="http://localhost:3000"
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DB="tutoriallm_db"
DB_HOST="db.tutoriallm.local"

DOMAIN="localhost"
EMAIL="example@example.com"

DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD="admin"
DEFAULT_USER_NAME="admin"
```

## Connecting to the Database

```md
TutoriaLLM requires a connection to PostgreSQL with pgvector enabled. Below is a guide to setting up pgvector using Docker Compose.
```

```yaml
import composeExample from "../../media/code/docker-compose.yml?raw";

<Code code={composeExample} lang="yaml" title="/docker-compose.yml" />
```

```

## Starting the Server

```md
Start the database:
```

```sh
docker compose up
```

```md
Start the frontend and backend with the following commands:
```

```sh
# Frontend
cd apps/frontend
pnpm i && pnpm dev

# Backend
cd apps/backend
pnpm i && pnpm dev
```

```md
<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  By default, TutoriaLLM uses port 3000 for the frontend and port 3001 for the API entry point.
</Aside>
```

## Sharing Type Definitions

```md
This repository uses a pnpm workspace to share type definitions between the frontend and backend. Type definitions are defined in the backend and can be used in the frontend.
```

```sh
# Generate type definitions in the backend
cd apps/backend
pnpm run build
```

## Developing Extensions

```md
Extensions are placed in the `/packages/extensions` directory by default. If you create an extension, add it to this directory. Values exported in `index.ts` are used by both the frontend and backend.
```

```md
<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  The directory structure for extensions may change in future versions.
</Aside>
```

```sh
After defining an extension, build it using the following command:

# Build the extension
pnpm run build
```

```md
Once built, type definitions are automatically shared between the frontend and backend.
```
